# jorgemfs.com Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website hosted at [jorgemfs.com](https://jorgemfs.com). The site presents my professional profile and related information.

## Building and running

This is a static site built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can preview it locally using any HTTP server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

The site is published via **GitHub Pages**. Pushing changes to the repository's `master` branch updates the content served at `jorgemfs.com`.

The template originally provided a PHP-based contact form. That functionality is disabled in this repository because it depends on a proprietary library that is not included. See `forms/Readme.txt` for details.

## Credits

The design is based on the [iPortfolio](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/) template by [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/).
